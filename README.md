# Master thesis Kirkeland
Code for Master's thesis "Machine learning approach for identification and tracking of coherent structures in turbulent fluids and plasmas"

The code is put in different groups, but there is no documentation due to lack of time. This is for exploration of how the experiments have been conducted. There is no quick testing of this. I do not know if all the files are in here, but the essentials are.

A lot of the files have been used many times, except the name of the load and save has been changed.
